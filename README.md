=========

Objective-C wrapper for the Riot Games API beta  

Currently, it only supports the champions endpoint, but is easily extensible to the others (I just need time to add them).

You can see API wrappers for other languages here: https://developer.riotgames.com/discussion/riot-games-api/show/iXR9Vl2A
