riot-objc
=========
**Early stage** Objective-C wrapper for the Riot Games API beta  

Currently, it only supports some of the endpoints, but is easily extensible to the others (I just need time to add them). See the Roadmap for what is currently supported.

### Roadmap/Progress
See https://github.com/im420blaziken/riot-objc/wiki/Roadmap-Progress

Getting Started
---------------
The first thing that you'll want to do is open `BLRiotAPI.h` and locate, near the top, `#define API_KEY`.  
Replace `YOUR-KEY-HERE` with your developer key, obtainable for free from Riot.  

Usage
-----
Live code examples can be seen in `BLRiotObjCViewController.m`.
