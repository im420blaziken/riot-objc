riot-objc
=========
**Early stage** Objective-C wrapper for the Riot Games API beta  

Currently, it only supports the champions endpoint, but is easily extensible to the others (I just need time to add them).

Progress
=========
champion-v1.1 **complete**  

game-v1.1  
 * endpoint macro defined  

league-v2.1  
 * endpoint macro defined  

stats-v1.1  
 * endpoint macros defined  

summoner-v1.1  
 * endpoint macros defined  

team-v2.1  
 * endpoint macro defined  

Usage
=========
Live code examples can be seen in `BLRiotObjCViewController.m`.
