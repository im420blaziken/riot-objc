riot-objc
=========
**Early stage** Objective-C wrapper for the Riot Games API beta  

Currently, it only supports the champions endpoint, but is easily extensible to the others (I just need time to add them).

### Roadmap/Progress
See Wiki

Getting Started
---------------
The first thing that you'll want to do is open `BLRiotAPI.h` and locate, near the top, `#define API_KEY`.  
Replace `YOUR-KEY-HERE` with your developer key, obtainable for free from Riot.  

Usage
-----
Live code examples can be seen in `BLRiotObjCViewController.m`.
